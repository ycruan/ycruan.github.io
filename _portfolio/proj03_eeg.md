Pattern Recognition in Brain Waves
======

Neural oscillations, also known as brain waves, have been most widely studied in neural activity generated by 
large groups of neurons. Large-scale activities can be measured by techniques like <b>EEG</b>. With the help of 
powerful machine learning models such as <b>PCA</b>, <b>t-SNE</b> and <b>neural networks</b>, in this project, 
we successfully detect the blink and concentration activity patterns from the EEG signal.

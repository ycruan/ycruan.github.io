On the Intensity Estimation of Poisson Process
======

Poisson process, homogeneous or inhomogeneous, plays a fundamental role in the theory and application of stochastic process. 
However, the intensity estimation of inhomogeneous Poisson process remains difficult. 
In this paper, we summarize three popular technologies for the intensity estimation of Poisson process: 
smoothing kernel method, Mercer kernel method, as well as Bayesian method.
The **smoothing kernel method** has elegant results for one-dimension stationary data. The **RKHS method** works 
by adjusting the kernel functions such that the **representerâ€™s theorem** can be applied. Similar 
method also works for data consists of multiple draws from some one-dimension Poisson process. 
Two **Bayesian approached** based on the LGCP model and the SGCP model are also discussed.

Welcome to my homepage!
======

My name is Yichen Ruan, people also call me Ethan. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [LIONS](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/) 
research group at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University. 
My advisor is [Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/). My research interests include fog computing, federated edge machine learning, 
and resource allocation in networked systems.

Before joining CMU, I got my M.S. degree in [Systems Engineering](https://www.ce.berkeley.edu/programs/sys) from UC Berkeley in 2017.
From 2012 to 2016, I am an undergraduate student in [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html), 
where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering, and the second Bachelor's degree in Economics.

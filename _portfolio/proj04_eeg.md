Pattern Recognition in Brain Waves
======

Brain waves have been widely used to measure human's physical and mental activities. Electroencephalography (<b>EEG</b>) is an 
electrophysiological monitoring method to record the brain waves. With the help of 
powerful machine learning models such as <b>PCA</b>, <b>t-SNE</b> and <b>neural networks</b>, in this project, 
we successfully detect the blink and concentration activity patterns from the EEG signal.

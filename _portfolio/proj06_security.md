This is a collection of course projects for Berkeley CS161: Computer Security (Term: 17 Fall, Grade: A).
* Project 1: Overflows ([spec](https://ycruan.github.io/files/161_project1_spec.pdf))
  * Inject shellcode to a x86 Linux VM exploiting format string overflow, off-by-one-byte attack and ret2esp attack.

* Project 2: Encrypted Cloud Drive ([spec](https://ycruan.github.io/files/161_project2_spec.pdf))
  * Design and implement a encrypted cloud drive that supports file `store`, `load`, `edit`, `append`, `share`, `receive`, 
  `rename`, `revoke`, using GoLang.

* Project 3: GFW ([spec](https://ycruan.github.io/files/161_project3_spec.pdf))
  * Implement `ping` and `traceroute` to inspect the hijacking mechanism of the Great Firewall of China.
